âœ… HTML: Structured the calculator layout with essential elements such as input fields, buttons, and containers.
âœ… CSS: Styled the calculator to make it visually appealing, using Flexbox/Grid for layout and ensuring mobile responsiveness with media queries.

ðŸ“± Key Features:

Supports basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)

Responsive design adapting to different screen sizes

Clear and backspace functionality for better user experience

Attractive UI with hover and active button effects

ðŸ”— Ideal for: Enhancing JavaScript skills and creating practical projects.
